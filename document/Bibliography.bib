    abstract = {Diversity among the base classifiers is deemed to be important
                when constructing a classifier ensemble. Numerous algorithms have
                been proposed to construct a good classifier ensemble by seeking
                both the accuracy of the base classifiers and the diversity among
                them. However, there is no generally accepted definition of
                diversity, and measuring the diversity explicitly is very
                difficult. Although researchers have designed several
                experimental studies to compare different diversity measures,
                usually confusing results were observed. In this paper, we
                present a theoretical analysis on six existing diversity measures
                (namely disagreement measure, double fault measure, KW variance,
                inter-rater agreement, generalized diversity and measure of
                difficulty), show underlying relationships between them, and
                relate them to the concept of margin, which is more explicitly
                related to the success of ensemble learning algorithms. We
                illustrate why confusing experimental results were observed and
                show that the discussed diversity measures are naturally
                ineffective. Our analysis provides a deeper understanding of the
                concept of diversity, and hence can help design better ensemble
                learning algorithms.},
